# Full Specification

## Version: 2.0.2

This specification details the storyboard schema; you can use this as a reference, but it is strongly encouraged to **read the entire document** before you start storyboarding to get a glimpse of the power (and limitations) of storyboarding.

ðŸŒŸ **Coordinate systems**

- Before we get into storyboarding, let's understand the game's different canvas and their coordinate systems:
    - The canvas for **storyboard** **sprites and texts**, or **stage**, has a resolution of 800 (width) * 600 (height). (0, 0) is at the center. (400, 300) is the upper right corner. (-400, -300) is the lower left corner.
        - The X and Y axes are called stageX and stageY.
    - The canvas for **notes** use the same unit as in charts, spanning [0, 1] in the X-axis and [0, 1] in the Y-axis, where (0, 0) is the lower left corner.
        - The X and Y axes are called noteX and noteY.

    - The game **camera** has its own frame of reference based on its [orthographic size](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera-orthographicSize.html). By default, camera is positioned at (0, 0).
        - The X and Y axes are called cameraX and cameraY.

    - Finally, there is also an Z axis for parameters that are, well, on the game's **Z axis**, or, the depth axis. You do not care about this axis unless you have set **perspective** to true in a scene controller.
        - Note that the camera is looking at the +Z direction, and is by default at Z = -10. Setting a value like Z = -8 will put camera closer to the notes, while a value like Z = -15 will distance it away from the notes.
- For any storyboard object property that uses a coordinate system above, you can **transform their coordinate systems** by using the following format: `[coordinate system]:[value]`.
    - For example, say you have a sprite which you would like to display at the left of the bottom boundary of the gameplay/note area, which is exactly (0, 0) when expressed in noteX and noteY coordinate systems. However, the `x` and `y` values of a sprite by default use the stageX and stageY coordinate systems.
        - Before coordinate system transformations are introduced in 2.0.0, this is typically done by calculating the screen aspect ratio to estimate the corresponding coordinate in the stage canvas. This requires the storyboarder to create different storyboards for different screen aspect ratios (as seen [here](https://cytoid.io/levels/tigertiger.deadsoul)), and does not take into consideration that players can change their horizontal/vertical margins of the gameplay/note area.
        - Starting from 2.0.0, we can simply use coordinate system transformations to express the actual coordinate, like below:

            ```json
            {
              ...
              Sprite definition
              ...
              "x": "noteX:0",
              "y": "noteY:0"
            }
            ```

            When the storyboard is loaded into the game, Cytoid automatically calculates the actual `x` and `y` valuesâ€”without getting into the boring technical details, all you need to know is that the sprite will show up at the desired position of (0, 0) on the note canvas!

    - A more practical problem: how can we stretch a sprite to be a square such that its top and bottom are aligned to the screen boundaries?
        - A naive attempt would be:

            ```json
            {
              ...
              Sprite definition
              ...
              "preserve_aspect": false, // Allow stretching of the sprite
              "width": 600,
              "height": 600
            }
            ```

            Unfortunately, this would not work: this is not necessarily a square. In fact, only devices with a 4:3 screen aspect ratio will render this as a square. Recall that the stage canvas resolution is 800 * 600 on **any** device, so 1 unit in stageX does not necessarily equal 1 unit in stageY.

            - More simply put, when we set a sprite's `width` and `height` to be both 600, what we actually mean is that this sprite takes up 600/800=3/4 of the screen width and 600/600=all of the screen height. Therefore, to make it a square, 3/4 of the screen width must be equal to all of the screen height, which enforces a 4:3 screen ratio.
        - To align the square with top and bottom boundaries of the screen, the `height` necessarily equals `600`; the problem stems from our defined `width`. So what went wrong? **We assumed 1 unit of `width` (stageX) is equal to 1 unit of `height` (stageY),** which we now know is not the case. Then, if we can somehow make `width` use the same unit as `height`...

            ```json
            {
              ...
              Sprite definition
              ...
              "preserve_aspect": false,
              "width": "stageY:600",
              "height": 600
            }
            ```

            And that is it! We delegated the calculation to Cytoidâ€”`stageY:600` means 600 units in the stageY coordinate system. Whatever that value is, this has made sure our sprite will stretch to a square.

    - Finally, you should probably not transform any value to/from the depth coordinate system, as it does not make mathematical sense. But you can do it nonetheless! Feel free to try. ðŸ˜‡

**Root object**

- **texts**: array of text objects.
- **sprites**: array of sprite objects.
- ðŸŒŸ **lines**: array of line objects.
- ðŸŒŸ **videos**: array of video objects. Experimental!
- **controllers**: array of scene controller objects.
    - You usually need only one controller to control the entire scene, but multiple controllers will come in handy if you need to define effects whose animation states overlap. For beginners, use only one controller.
- ðŸŒŸ **note_controllers**: array of note controller objects.
- **templates**: array of templates.

**Base state** (Parameters inherited by all objects)

- ðŸŒŸ There are two kinds of objects: **scene objects** (texts, sprites, lines, and videos) that appear in the scene, and **controller objects** (scene controllers and note controllers) that manipulate the scene components without an entity form.
- States control how objects behave at different points of time. Not every moment of the object needs to be a state; only the "key" moments need to be defined.
- For instance, consider a title text that flies from the bottom to the center of the screen from time=0 to time=3. Theoretically, it has infinitely many states, because at every moment its position is different. However, there are only two "key" states: 1. text at the bottom at time=0; 2. text at the center at time=3. Simply define these two states, and the storyboard will automatically calculate all the states in between.
- Every defined object has at least one state, which is the initial state. You can define extra states of this object in the `states` array.
- **id**: an unique string identifier of this object. If not set, a random alphanumeric ID will be generated. Supports the `$note` placeholder (see the note controller section).
- ðŸŒŸ **target_id**: *for scene objects only.* When `target_id` is set to an ID of an object, this object does not have its own entity form but will control the specified instance instead. Supports the `$note` placeholder (see the note controller section).
    - This is useful if you want to *create animations that require overlapping states*. For example, if you want to move a sprite in an arc, it is impossible to do this with only one scene object. You need twoâ€”one moves the sprite in the X direction with one easing (say, `linear`), and another one moves the sprite in the Y direction with another easing (say, `easeOutQuad`). Like below:

        ```json
        {
        	"id": "sprite",
        	"path": "dot.png",
        	"time": 0,
        	"x": 0,
        	"easing": "linear",
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"time": 5,
        			"x": 200
        		}
        	]
        },
        {
        	"target_id": "sprite",
        	"time": 0,
        	"y": 0,
        	"easing": "easeOutQuad",
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"time": 5,
        			"y": 200,
        		}
        	]
        }
        ```

    - Another example would be to simplify complex states. Say you want to move a text from x=0 at t=0 to x=100 at t=5, while also setting its opacity from a=1 at t=2.5 to a=0 at t=7.5. Without using a separate targeting scene object, you have to manually do some mental calculations to write down the 4 key states.
    - Keep in mind that the targeted object must be of same type of the current object. For example, you cannot set a sprite's target to be a text.
- ðŸŒŸ **parent_id**: *for texts and sprites only.* ****When `parent_id` is set to an ID of an object, this object's movement follows the specified parent, i.e. this object's coordinate system is now relative to the parent's coordinate system. Supports the `$note` placeholder (see the note controller section).
    - For example, you can set sprite A's parent to be sprite B, so that when sprite A moves with sprite B. Any translation of sprite A is now using sprite B's position as the origin.
    - Another fun thing to try is to set a sprite's parent to a note controller. Since a note controller has an implied position of the actual note, the sprite should follow the note's movement.
        - *No, you can't really make custom skins with this yet.* See the note controller section for a in-depth explanation.
- **time**: the base time of this object state, measured in seconds. Note that this may not be equivalent to the true timingâ€”see how an object's exact timing is calculated below.
    - **If `time` is not set and this is a scene object (i.e. text or sprite), this scene object is not spawned unless manually spawned by a trigger.**
    - If the value is in one of the following formats, an automatic replacement will be performed. Note that the quotes are necessary. `<Note ID>` supports the `$note` placeholder (see the note controller section).
        - `"start:<Note ID>"`: start time of the specified note
        - `"end:<Note ID>"`: end time of the specified note
        - `"intro:<Note ID>"`: intro time (i.e. when the note fades in) of the specified note
        - `"start:<Note ID>:<Offset>"`: start time of the specified note + `<Offset>` (in seconds, can be negative)
        - `"end:<Note ID>:<Offset>"`: end time of the specified note + `<Offset>` in seconds, can be negative)
        - `"intro:<Note ID>:<Offset>"`: intro time (i.e. when the note fades in) of the specified note + `<Offset>` (in seconds, can be negative)
        - ðŸŒŸ `"at:<Note ID>:<Percentage>"`: *for hold notes only.* start time of the specified note + (end time of the specified note - start time of the specified note) * `<Percentage>`
            - When `<Percentage>` is `0`, this is equivalent to `start`
            - When `<Percentage>` is `1`, this is equivalent to `end`
    - This value can also be an array, if you want to create multiple identical states at once. For example:

        ```json
        "states": [
        	{
        		"template": "pulse",
        		"time": ["start:57", "start:123", "start:153"]
        	}
        ]
        ```

        is automatically expanded to

        ```json
        "states": [
        	{
        		"template": "pulse",
        		"time": "start:57"
        	},
        	{
        		"template": "pulse",
        		"time": "start:123"
        	},
        	{
        		"template": "pulse",
        		"time": "start:153"
        	}
        ]
        ```

- **relative_time**: the relative time to the parent state. For example,

    ```json
    {
    	"time": 5,
    	"states": [
    		{
    			// State A
    			"relative_time": 2.5
    		}
    	]
    }
    ```

    The timing of state A would be `5` + `2.5` = `7.5`.

- **add_time**: the relative time to the last defined state. For example,

    ```json
    {
    	"time": 5,
    	"states": [
    		{
    			"relative_time": 2.5
    		},
    		{
    			// State B
    			"add_time": 3
    		}
    	]
    }
    ```

    The timing of state B would be (`5` + `2.5`) + `3` = `10.5`.

- How an object's exact timing is calculated, from highest priority to lowest priority:
    - if `add_time` is defined: timing of the last defined state + `add_time`
    - if `relative_time` is defined, and `time` is also defined: `time` + `relative_time`
    - if `relative_time` is defined, and there exists a parent state: timing of the parent state + `relative_time`
    - if `relative_time` is defined, but there does not exist a parent state: current game time + `relative_time` **(Note: this is intended for triggers)**
    - if both `add_time` and `relative_time` are undefined: `time`
- **easing**: the easing used when animating this object from the current state to the next state. See [https://easings.net/](https://easings.net/). Default `linear`.
- **destroy**: if set to `true`, this object is destroyed **when it fully transitions into this state**. For the sake of performance, it is ***strongly recommended*** to destroy an object when you do not need to use it anymore.
    - In the following example along with the uses of triggers, the `Hello world!` text is spawned and displayed when note 4 is cleared, transitions into zero opacity before destroyed.

        ```json
        ...	
        	"texts": [
        		{
        			"id": "hello_world",
        			"text": "Hello world!",
        			"size": 80,
        			"opacity": 1,
        			"states": [
        				{
        					"opacity": 0,
        					"relative_time": 0.5,
        					"destroy": true
        				}
        			]
        		}
        	],
        	"triggers": [
        		{
        			"type": "noteClear",
        			"notes": [4],
        			"spawn": ["hello_world"]
        		}
        	],
        ...
        ```

- **states**: array of the extra states of this object.
    - You can define states in an inner state, which will be appended to the parent object. For example:

        ```json
        {
          ...
        	Object definition
        	...
        	"states": [ // States defined in the parent object
        		{
        			"template": "stateA",
        		},
        		{
        			"states": [ // States defined in an inner state
        				{
        					"template": "stateB"
        				},
        				{
        					"template": "stateC"
        				}
        			]
        		},
        		{
        			"template": "stateD"
        		}
        	]
        }
        ```

        is equivalent to

        ```json
        {
          ...
        	Object definition
        	...
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"template": "stateA",
        		},
        		{
        			"template": "stateB"
        		},
        		{
        			"template": "stateC"
        		},
        		{
        			"template": "stateD"
        		}
        	]
        }
        ```

        This is useful when you want to reuse multiple states at once. See the `pulse` template in the storyboard example.

**Scene object state** (Parameters inherited by text, sprite, video and line states)

- **x**: x-coordinate of the object. Default `0`. Default coordinate system stageX.
- **y**: y-coordinate of the object. Default `0`. Default coordinate system stageY.
- ðŸŒŸ **z**: z-coordinate of the object. Default `0`. Default coordinate system depth.
    - Use only when perspective camera is enabled.
- **rot_x**: rotation of the object on the x-axis in degrees. Default `0`.
- **rot_y**: rotation of the object on the y-axis in degrees. Default `0`.
- **rot_z**: rotation of the object on the z-axis in degrees. Default `0`.
- **scale_x**: scale of the object on the x-axis. Default `1`.
- **scale_y**: scale of the object on the y-axis. Default `1`.
- **scale**: scale of the object on both axes. If used, `scale_x` and `scale_y` are overridden.
- **pivot_x**: pivot of the object when rotating/scaling on the x-axis. `0` is at left and `1` is at right. Default `0.5` (center).
- **pivot_y**: pivot of the object when rotating/scaling on the y-axis. `0` is at bottom and `1` is at top. Default `0.5` (center).
- **opacity**: transparency of the object. `0` is fully invisible while `1` is fully visible. Default `0`.
    - That means **all scene objects are invisible** until you animate `opacity` to any value greater than `0`.
- **width**: width of the object. Default coordinate system stageX.
- **height**: height of the object. Default coordinate system stageY.
    - ðŸŒŸ Starting from 2.0.0, **text objects automatically fit to their content** (`text`). That means setting `width` and `height` on a text will not do anything.
    - For sprites, the default dimensions are 200 (width) * 200 (height).
- **layer:** layer of the object. Default `0`.
    - `0`: The default layer. Behind all game elements except the background.
    - `1`: Above all note elements, but under UI elements.
    - `2`: Above all game elements.
- **order**: order of the object ***within its `layer`***. For example, an object with order `3` will display in front of an object with order `2`, assuming they have the same `layer`. If both objects have the same order, the later defined object will display in front of the earlier defined object.
    - ðŸŒŸ Remember to always set the proper `order` on sprites! Otherwise, they may not show up in the actual game even they show up in CytoidPlayer. If you are unsure, you can just set it to `0`.
- **fill_width**: if `true`, `width` and `height` are ignored, and this scene object automatically scratches to the stage's width and has a height of `10000`.
    - Useful if you just want to make a sprite that fills the entire viewport, like a background image.

**Text state**

- **text**: the text to be displayed. Note that (very limited) [rich text](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StyledText.html) is supported (bold, italic, inline size, inline color).
- **color**: color of the text in the hex representation (i.e. "#fff" or "#4568dc"). Default `"#fff"` (white).
- **size**: font size of the text. Default `20`.
    - To animate the size of a text, animate its `scale` property. Do not animate `size`, which only takes integer values and is resource-intensive.
- **align**: text alignment. `upperLeft`, `upperCenter`, `upperRight`, `middleLeft`, `middleCenter`, `middleRight`, `lowerLeft`, `lowerCenter`, `lowerRight` are supported. Default `middleCenter`.
- ðŸŒŸ **letter_spacing**: letter spacing. Default `0`.
- ðŸŒŸ **font_weight**: font weight. `regular`, `extraLight`, `bold`, `extraBold` are supported. Default `regular`.

**Sprite state**

- **path**: relative path to the image file. For example, if the path is `"sprite.png"`, the file should be at the same location as the `storyboard.json` and named `sprite.png`. Only `.jpg` and `.png` are supported. **For best performance, keep resolution below 1920 px * 1080 px, and convert PNGs to JPGs when transparency is not needed.**
- **preserve_aspect**: if `true`, the image aspect ratio is preserved. Default `true`.
- **color**: color tint of the sprite in the hex representation. Default `"#fff"` (white), which is equivalent to untinted.

ðŸŒŸ **Video state** Experimental!

- **path**: relative path to the video file. **Since supported video codecs are different across platforms and devices, it is strongly recommended to use a standard H.264 `.mp4` file at maximum 720p resolution.**
    - Video **will not pause** when the game is paused. This is a known issue.
- **color**: color tint of the video in the hex representation. Default `"#fff"` (white), which is equivalent to untinted.

ðŸŒŸ **Note controller state**

- A note controller overrides and animates the properties a single note defined in the chart file. This is the most powerful storybaord technique so far. **You can implement almost any desired gameplay in Cytoid using note controllers!**
- **note**: integer ID of the note, as defined in the chart file.
- **override_x**: if `true`, the x-coordinate of the note is overriden. See `x`, `x_multiplier` and `dx`. Default `false`.
- **x**: overridden x-coordinate of the note. Default coordinate system noteX.
    - Reminder that you can unset this value by setting it to `null`.
- **x_multiplier**: multiplies onto the x-coordinate of the note. Default `1`. Has no effect if `x` is already set.
- **dx**: adds onto the x-coordinate of the note. Default `0`. Default coordinate system noteX. Has no effect if `x` is already set.
- **override_y**: if `true`, the y-coordinate of the note is overriden. See `y`, `y_multiplier` and `dy`. Default `false`.
- **y**: overridden y-coordinate of the note. Default coordinate system noteY.
    - Reminder that you can unset this value by setting it to `null`.
- **y_multiplier**: multiplies onto the y-coordinate of the note. Default `1`. Has no effect if `y` is already set.
- **dy**: adds onto the y-coordinate of the note. Default `0`. Default coordinate system noteY. Has no effect if `y` is already set.
    - **BUG WARNING! As of 2.0.2, this property is incorrectly implemented, and you have to add `1` to the value you want to set for notes that are in a chart page of `-1` direction.**
        - `dx` and `dy` will be replaced with `x_offset` and `y_offset` in the future. In the meantime, you can still use `dy`â€”just be very careful of it. If the note positions do not match with your expectations, add `1` to it.
- How the x-coordinate of a note is calculated, from highest priority to lowest priority:
    - If `override_x` is `true` and `x` is defined: `x`
    - If `override_x` is `true` and `x` is not defined (`null`): original x-coordinate * `x_multiplier` + `dx`
    - Otherwise: original x-coordinate
    - Same applies to the y-coordinate.
- **override_z**: if `true`, the z-coordinate of the note is overriden. See `z`. Default `false`.
- **z**: overridden z-coordinate of the note. Default coordinate system depth.
- **override_rot_x**: if `true`, the rotation of the note on the x-axis is overriden. See `rot_x`. Default `false`.
- **rot_x**: overridden rotation of the note on the x-axis in degrees. Default `0`.
- **override_rot_y**: if `true`, the rotation of the note on the y-axis is overriden. See `rot_y`. Default `false`.
- **rot_y**: overridden rotation of the note on the y-axis in degrees. Default `0`.
- **override_rot_z**: if `true`, the rotation of the note on the z-axis is overriden. See `rot_z`. Default `false`.
- **rot_z**: overridden rotation of the note on the z-axis in degrees. Default `0`.
- **override_ring_color**: if `true`, the ring color of the note is overriden. See `ring_color`. Default `false`.
- **ring_color**: overridden ring color of the note. When set to `null`, user ring color is used. Default `null`.
- **override_fill_color**: if `true`, the fill color of the note is overriden. See `fill_color`. Default `false`.
- **fill_color**: overridden fill color of the note. When set to `null`, user fill color is used. Default `null`.
- **opacity_multiplier**: multiplies onto the opacity of the note. Default `1`.
- **size_multiplier**: multiplies onto the size of the note. Default `1`.
    - **BUG WARNING! As of 2.0.2, this property only works on clicks and flicks.**
- **hold_direction**: direction of the "tail" of a hold note; only applicable if `note` is a hold note. `1` is upwards and `-1` is downwards. When set to `null`, original hold direction is used. Default `null`.
- **style**: controls specific styling of the note; only applicable to hold notes for now. `1` and `2` are supported. Default `1`.
    - `1`: The default style.
    - `2`: The triangle that connects the scanline and the hold note will be hidden; the tail becomes shorter as the hold note progresses; the clear effect will be played at the hold note, not the scanline's position.
- Now you know how to control a note with a note controller, you will soon find this job tedious: what if I want to control, say, all flick notes, or all notes from ID 300 to 500? **Note selectors** come to the rescue!
- A note selector is an JSON object (i.e. wrapped in `{}` braces) with following properties:
    - **type**: array of acceptable note types. For example, `[3,4,6,7]` selects all drags and c-drags.
    - **start**: minimum ID of the note.
    - **end**: maximum ID of the note.
    - **direction**: direction of the note's page. `1` indicates that this note is scanned upwards, and `-1` indicates that this note is scanned downwards.
    - **min_x**: minimum x-coordinate of the note.
    - **max_x**: maximum x-coordinate of the note.
- Note selectors are best understood by thinking them as "filters" on notes. Following are some examples:
    - Select all click notes with ID ranged from 250-275:

        ```json
        {
        	"type": [0],
        	"start": 250,
        	"end": 275
        }
        ```

    - Select all notes on the left side of the screen:

        ```json
        {
          "min_x": 0,
          "max_x": 0.5
        }
        ```

    - Select all notes which will be scanned by the scanline downwards:

        ```json
        {
        	"direction": -1
        }
        ```

    - Select all notes (equivalently, apply no filters):

        ```json
        {}
        ```

- To use a note selector, simply set it as the `note` of a predefined note controller:

    ```json
    {
      "note": {
        "start": 7,
    		"end": 9
      },
      "override_x": true,
      "x": 0.25
    }
    ```

    When loaded into the game, Cytoid filters the notes with the conditions defined in the selector. In this case, we know exactly 3 notes will be selected. This note controller is then automatically expanded into 3 note controllers:

    ```json
    {
      "note": 7,
      "override_x": true,
      "x": 0.25
    },
    {
      "note": 8,
      "override_x": true,
      "x": 0.25
    },
    {
      "note": 9,
      "override_x": true,
      "x": 0.25
    }
    ```

    Which, as you expect, aligns the 3 notes at x = 0.25.

- **(Advanced)** An interesting detail: you can actually use note selectors in other scene objects, such as sprites and texts. For example:

    ```json
    {
    ...
    	"sprites": [
    		{
    			"note": {},
    			"path": "image.jpg"
    		}
    	]
    ...
    }
    ```

    This spawns an image for every note. Pretty useless, right?â€”You will see in a second how this will be useful in conjunction with the `$note` placeholder.

- The last piece of our note controller toolbox is the `**$note` placeholder**. It can be used in `id`, `parent_id`, `target_id` and `time`; each occurrence will be replaced by the note ID in the current context. Do not worry if this sounds confusing to you at first, because it is.
    - We start with an example to illustrate why we need the `$note` placeholder. Imagine we want to fade out a note as soon as it appears (similar to the ["hidden" mod in osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Game_modifier/Hidden)). Let's say this note has an ID of 100. We can come up with the note controller pretty quickly:

        ```json
        {
        	"note": 100,
          "opacity": 1,
        	"time": "intro:100",
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"opacity": 0,
        			"time": "intro:100:0.2"
        		}
        	]
        }
        ```

        As soon as the note appears, this note controller starts to take effect and eventually fades out the note completely after 0.2 seconds. It works, so what is the problem?

    - The problem is this solution does not scale. What if we want to fade out all the notes after they appear? It is tempting to use a note selector that we just learned, but...

        ```json
        {
        	"note": {},
          "opacity": 1,
        	"time": "intro:???", // What note ID should we use?
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"opacity": 0,
        			"time": "intro:???:0.2" // What note ID should we use?
        		}
        	]
        }
        ```

        Recall that from our previous knowledge, a note selector is just a useful "syntax sugar" that creates a note controller for every selected note with *the same set of properties*. In this case, every note controller do not actually share the same set of properties; the values of `time` must point to the intro time of *different* notes in each expanded note controller. This is what we would like to see:

        ```json
        {
        	"note": 1,
          "opacity": 1,
        	"time": "intro:1",
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"opacity": 0,
        			"time": "intro:1:0.2"
        		}
        	]
        },
        {
        	"note": 2,
          "opacity": 1,
        	"time": "intro:2", // Different from the first note controller!
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"opacity": 0,
        			"time": "intro:2:0.2" // Different from the first note controller!
        		}
        	]
        },
        ...
        ```

        This is where the `$note` placeholder can help us. Recall that every occurrence of  `$note` in property `id`, `parent_id`, `target_id` or `time` is replaced by the note ID in the current context, or, more simply put, by the note ID of the controller where the property is located. In other words, we can write:

        ```json
        {
        	"note": {},
          "opacity": 1,
        	"time": "intro:$note",
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"opacity": 0,
        			"time": "intro:$note:0.2"
        		}
        	]
        }
        ```

        Which is first automatically expanded into:

        ```json
        {
        	"note": 1,
          "opacity": 1,
        	"time": "intro:$note",
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"opacity": 0,
        			"time": "intro:$note:0.2"
        		}
        	]
        },
        {
        	"note": 2,
          "opacity": 1,
        	"time": "intro:$note",
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"opacity": 0,
        			"time": "intro:$note:0.2"
        		}
        	]
        },
        ...
        ```

        Then every `$note` is automatically replaced by the actual note ID in their context:

        ```json
        { 
          // Within this note controller, $note is always 1
        	"note": 1,
          "opacity": 1,
        	"time": "intro:1", // $note replaced by 1
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"opacity": 0,
        			"time": "intro:1:0.2" // $note replaced by 1
        		}
        	]
        },
        {
          // Within this note controller, $note is always 2
        	"note": 2,
          "opacity": 1,
        	"time": "intro:2", // $note replaced by 2
        	"states": [
        		{
        			"opacity": 0,
        			"time": "intro:2:0.2" // $note replaced by 2
        		}
        	]
        },
        ...
        ```

        Which is exactly what we want. Isn't that beautiful?

    - **(Advanced)** Protip: we showed how to use `$note` in `time`, but how about in `id`, `parent_id` and `target_id`? It turns out, like note selectors, the `$note` placeholder can be used in any other scene object. We just showed above how to spawn a sprite for every note, so let's see how to make them appear together with the noteâ€”or, custom note skins!

        ```json
        {
        ...
        	"note_controllers": [
        		{
        			"note": {},
        			"id": "note_controller_$note",
        			"time": 0,
        			"opacity_multiplier": 0
        		} // Creates a note controller for each note, each with a distinct id, and makes the note invisible
        	],
        	"sprites": [
        		{
        			"path": "image.jpg"
        			"note": {}, // Spawn an image for each note...
        			"parent_id": "note_controller_$note", // ...that locates and moves relative to the note (i.e. follows the note)
        			"opacity": 0,			
        			"time": "intro:$note", // ...that is hidden until the note appears
        			"states": [
        				{
        					"opacity": 1,
        					"time": "start:$note" // ...that becomes fully visible when the note is meant to be hit
        				},
        				{
        					"add_time": 0.5,
        					"destroy": true // Destroy after 0.5 seconds
        				}
        			]
        		}
        	]
        ...
        }
        ```

        Unfortunately, this looks more promising than it actually is. If you hit the notes early, the note controller no longer has a valid position, so the skin sprite resets its position and "teleports" to the center of the screen. When storyboard events are implemented in the future, we will be able to destroy the sprite as soon as the note is cleared, mimicking note skinning more convincingly.

        - An important takeaway here, though, is that although note controllers do not appear in the game, they actually have an **implicit position**, which is aligned with the position of their target note! Therefore, if you ever want to align some scene object with a note, just define a note controller for that note and set the parent of the scene object to the note controller.
- A few common tricks:
    - To create vertical-scrolling style gameplay, simply set `override_y` to `true`, and animate `y` from `2` (or any value that is surely out of the vertical screen boundary) at time = `intro:$note` to `0` at time = `start:$note`.
        - In the [Interference: Finale](https://cytoid.io/levels/io.cytoid.interference3) EX storyboard, vertical-scrolling style gameplay is mixed with scanline gameplay. This is achieved by the charter first predefining a set of notes in the storyboard at a fixed X value, say, 0.4. Then the storyboarder uses a note selector that selects notes at X = 0.4 and animates them so that only they would fall onto the bottom of the screen, while other notes remain "normal."
            - Note: Due to accuracy issues of decimals, do not select notes at X = 0.4 like this:

                ```json
                {
                	"min_x": 0.4,
                	"max_x": 0.4
                }
                ```

                Instead, do:

                ```json
                {
                	"min_x": 0.39999,
                	"max_x": 0.40001
                }
                ```

    - To move a note in a curve, use two note controllers, one animates `x` and one animates `y`, each with different `easing` (for example, `easeInCirc` and `easeOutCirc` so that the note follows a trajectory of quarter of a circle).
    - Fix `y` to a constant value to mimic osu-style gameplay.

ðŸŒŸ **Line state**

- "Line" is actually a misnomer. A line object renders connected line segments. You can use it to mimic a scanline or draw any geometry shape, like a triangle.
- Although the line state *technically* inherits from the scene object state, only a very limited subset of parameters in the scene object state are supported: `opacity`, `layer` and `order`.
- **pos**: array of vertex objects.
    - Each vertex is a JSON object with following properties:
        - **x**: x-coordinate of the vertex. Default coordinate system noteX.
        - **y**: y-coordinate of the vertex. Default coordinate system noteY.
        - **z**: z-coordinate of the vertex. Default coordinate system depth.
- **width**: width of the line segments. Default `0.05`.
- **color**: color of the line segments in the hex representation. Default `"#fff"` (white).
- An example to animate a triangle using two line states:

    ```json
    {
      "time": 0,
      "opacity": 1,
      "pos": [
        {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0
        },
        {
          "x": 1,
          "y": 0
        },
        {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 1
        },
        {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0
        }
      ],
      "states": [
        {
          "time": 20,
          "pos": [
            {
              "x": 0,
              "y": 1
            },
            {
              "x": 1,
              "y": 0
            },
            {
              "x": 1,
              "y": 1
            },
            {
              "x": 0,
              "y": 1
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Try this yourself and figure out why the triangle animates like that! ðŸ˜‰

**Scene controller state**

- **storyboard_opacity**: `opacity` of all storyboard scene objects. Default `1`.
- **ui_opacity**: opacity of the game UI (score, info, pause button...). Default `1`.
- **scanline_opacity**: opacity of the scanline. Default `1`.
- **background_dim**: opacity of the background dim. Default `0.85`.
- **note_opacity_multiplier**: `opacity` of all notes will be multiplied by this value. Default `1`.
- **scanline_color**: override the scanline color. If not set (or set to `null`), `#ffffff` will be used when the chart is not changing speed, `#d25669` for speeding up,  `#a0c8bf` for speeding down.
- **note_ring_color**: override the ring color of all note. If not set (or set to `null`), user ring color is used.
- ðŸŒŸ **note_fill_colors**: override the fill colors of **different types of notes**.
    - Format: `[click 1, click 2, drag 1, drag 2, hold 1, hold 2, long hold 1, long hold 2, flick 1, flick 2, c-drag 1, c-drag 2]`
    - The following example sets the color of all click notes to `#4568dc` and the color of all flick notes to `#000000`:

        ```json
        ...
        "note_fill_colors": ["#4568dc", "#4568dc", 
        											null, null, 
        											null, null, 
        											null, null,
        											"#000000", "#000000",
        											null, null],
        ...
        ```

    - Note: if any color is not set (or set to `null`), user color will be used.
- **override_scanline_pos**: if `true`, the y-coordinate of the scanline is overriden. See `scanline_pos`. Default `false`.
- **scanline_pos**: overridden y-coordinate of the scanline. Default minimum `0` and maximum `1`, but out-of-bound values are also accepted. Default coordinate system noteY.
- **perspective**: if `true`, a perspective camera is used; if `false`, an orthographic camera is used. Default `true`.
- **size**: only takes effect if `perspective` is `false`. Controls the viewport size of the orthographic camera. Larger the size, smaller the scene. Default `5`.
- **fov**: only takes effect if `perspective` is `true`. Controls the field of view of the perspective camera (basically equivalent to `size`, but for the perspective camera). Larger the field of view, smaller the scene. Default `53.2`.
    - Hint: to create the pulsing effect, increase this value from `53.2` to `59.2` (or any number larger than `53.2`), then decrease to `53.2` again.
    - `53.2` is a magic number that ensures even in perspective mode, the note size is approximately the same as in orthographic mode.
- **x**: x-coordinate of the camera. A greater value shifts the whole scene to left, vice versa. A length of `1` is equivalent to half the screen width. Default `0`. Default coordinate system cameraX.
- **y**: y-coordinate of the camera. A greater value shifts the whole scene to bottom, vice versa. A length of `1` is equivalent to half the screen height. Default `0`. Default coordinate system cameraY.
- ðŸŒŸ **z**: z-coordinate of the camera. A greater value moves the camera closer to the notes, vice versa. Default `-10`. Default coordinate system depth.
- **rot_x**, **rot_y**, **rot_z**: rotations of the camera. Default `0`.
    - Hint: if you rotate along the x or y axis, part of the scene may not be able to be seen; you have to adjust the coordinates of the camera accordingly. If change `rot_x`, move `y`; if change `rot_y`, move `x`.

**~~Trigger State *(Experimental)*~~**

- ~~Note that triggers are currently poorly optimized. Spawning high-resolution sprites may result in lag spikes.~~
- **~~type**: type of the trigger.~~
    - `~~noteClear`: If any note in `notes` is cleared, this trigger is fired.~~
    - `~~combo`: If the combo amount reachs `combo`, this trigger is fired.~~
    - `~~score`: If the score amount reaches `score`, this trigger is fired **and destroyed, regardless of `uses`**.~~
- **~~uses**: maximum amount of times this trigger is allowed to fire. If set to `0`, this trigger is allowed to fire indefinitely. Default `0`.~~
- **~~notes**: (only when `type` equals `noteClear`) a list of note ids.~~
    - ~~Example: if set to `[352, 353, 390]` and `type` is set to `noteClear`, this trigger will fire when any of the notes 352, 353, and 390 is cleared.~~
- **~~combo**: (only when `type` equals `combo`) an integer.~~
- **~~score**: (only when `type` equals `score`) an integer.~~
- **~~spawn**: a list of object ids to spawn.~~
- **~~destroy**: a list of object ids to destroy. (Destroyed objects can be spawned again by another trigger.)~~
