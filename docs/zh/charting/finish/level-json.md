# Building level.json file

- A level.json is a file that contains information about your chart.
- This file is necessary for previewing charts in CytoidPlayer and submitting charts to Cytoid.io.

### Arguments and their values

- `schema_version`: Determines your level schema version. Its value must be: `2`.
- `version`: Determines your level version. Start with `1`, if you changed something in your chart, go up by 1. Ex.: `"version": 1`
- `id`: Determines your chart's unique ID. Its value must be a string and lowercased, we recommend you use as your chart's unique ID: `<your_name>.<chart_name>`. Ex.: `"id": "abcde.testsong"`.
- `title`: The song title, its value must be a string. Ex.: `"title": "You are the Miserable"`

    - `name`: Determines the name of the current difficulty, value must be a string. Ex.: `"type": "Easy"`.
    - `difficulty`: Determines how hard the current difficulty is, value must be an integer and rated from 0 to 16
      - **Note: Use 0 if it's a troll chart, 16 is displayed as 15+ on Cytoid**
      - Ex.: `"difficulty": 13`
    - `path`: The path to your chart in the current difficulty. Ex.: `"path": "chart.easy.txt"`
    - `music_override`: Use this in-between 2 or more difficulties if they use a different background music
      - Use a curly bracket to start
      - `path`: The path to your music file, its value must be a string. Ex.: `"path": "preview.wav"`
      - Use curly bracket again to mark the end of this value

      - Use a curly bracket to start
      - `path`: The path to your storyboard file, its value must be a string. Ex.: `"path": "sb.hard.json"`
