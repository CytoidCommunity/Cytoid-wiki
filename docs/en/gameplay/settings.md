# Game UI

## Game modes

There are 5 game modes in Cytoid: Free Play, Community, Events, Training and Tiers.

### Free Play

> The classic game mode for everyone!

This mode allows you to:

- Select and play all downloaded levels even you’re offline.
- Display levels by category: All, Official, and Community
- Sort all levels by added date, played date, difficulty, title, and play count.
- Delete levels.

### Community

> The Community Area is the best way to browse and download 6000+ custom levels, all created by Cytoid players. New levels are uploaded every day, so be sure to check back daily!

This mode allows you to browse and download levels online without leaving the game. A CytoidID is required.

### Events

> We host seasonal as well as collaborative events with other independent creators/games. When that happens, they show up here.

You can play event charts, unlock event tier(s), and get character(s) in a limited time. A CytoidID is required.

### Training

> If you're just getting started and want to get better, this is the right place. Play the levels here first to get comfortable with Cytoid's gameplay.

This mode allows you to play 15 levels, ranged from Lv. 1 to Lv. 15. You also can tap the character on the left (Kaede) to get advice depending on your current rating. A CytoidID is required.

### Tiers

> The tier ranking system judges and quantifies your skill level at Cytoid; if you ever feel confident enough to take the challenge, please come anytime!

You will have to play **3 preset charts in a row** (with a HP gauge) and clear the requirements. You also **can not** pause or leaving the game while playing.

These tiers are sorted by difficulty, means higher tier, more difficult. Tier 6 is the current highest tier.

Only *Fast*, *Slow*, *No Scanner*, and *Invisible* modifiers are allowed.
