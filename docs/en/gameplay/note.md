- There are 6 note types in Cytoid, they're: Tap, Drag, C-Drag, Hold, Long hold, Flick.

## Click

![Click](./_source_note.md/click.gif){.side-img}

- You just have to tap whenever the inner colored circle is close to the outer ring.

## Drag

![Drag](./_source_note.md/drag.gif){.side-img}

- Simply slide along the line through the small circles.
- You don't need to wait for the scanner, but don't drag too far ahead because you might mess up your rhythm.

## C-Drag

![C-Drag](./_source_note.md/c-drag.gif){.side-img}

- This is a "hybrid" of Click and Drag.
- Its "drag head" has click note's mechanics.
- That means you have to touch when the scanner reaches it, then slide your finger along the line with connecting notes.

## Hold

![Hold](./_source_note.md/hold.gif){.side-img}

- Have your finger on the circle before the scanner has reached it.
- Hold it there until the scanner has gone to the end of the line coming out of the circle.
- You don't need to release it. You also don't need to tap it like the click note, so you can slide onto it like a drag note.

## Long hold

![Long Hold](./_source_note.md/long_hold.gif){.side-img}

- A variant of the hold note.
- You usually need to hold your finger longer than a page.
- You can see how long you need to hold if you look at the pulsing ring around the circle.

## Flick

![Flick](./_source_note.md/flick.gif){.side-img}

- A different version of click notes.
- You need to tap and slide away from it horizontally.
