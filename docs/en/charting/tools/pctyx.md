# Charting with PCtyx

::: warning NOTICE
This is a guide about how to set up PCtyx.

## Getting PCtyx binaries on GitHub

1. Go to PCtyx repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/XionUzuki/PCtyx)

2. Look at the right sidebar, click on **Releases**

3. Carefully read the release note to choose a suitable version for your usage

4. On *Assets*, choose the zipped file depending on your current operating system (OS) and architecture

5. Check your file again, the file will look like this: `pctyxeditor_<version>_<OS><architecture>.zip`. Example: `pctyxeditor_300a03_win64.zip` (means version: 300a03, OS: Windows, Architecture: x64)

6. Extract the downloaded file somewhere you wanted

## Running PCtyx

### Windows

Just go to the PCtyx folder and run PCtyxEditor.exe

### MacOS

It depends on which version you're using.

::: details v210 or higher:
Just go to the PCtyx folder and run `pctyxeditor.app`
:::

::: details v201:

Follow these steps before running:

1. Download [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/downloads/) **(using the Stable version is recommended)** and extract `nwjs.app` into a new folder.
2. Copy `keymap.json` to that new folder where you extracted `nwjs.app`.
3. Right-click `pctyxeditor.app` and select "Show Package Contents".
4. Copy PCtyx's `Contents/Resources` folder.
5. Right-click --> "Show Package Contents" on `nwjs.app` and replace the `Contents/Resources` folder with the copied PCtyx one.
6. Download [FFmpeg](https://github.com/iteufel/nwjs-ffmpeg-prebuilt/releases) and extract `<your NW.JS version>-osx-x64.zip`, then copy `libffmpeg.dylib`.
7. Go to `nwjs.app`'s `Contents/Frameworks/nwjs Framework.framework/Versions/Current` and replace the `libffmpeg.dylib` with the copied one.

You don't need to do these again in the future.
