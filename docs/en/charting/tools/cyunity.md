![](./_sources_cyunity.md/1.png)
### 1. Project Operations
- **New**: Start a new project.

- **Open**: Opens an existing project.

- **Save**: Saves your project.

- **Save As**: Saves your project under a declared filename (author’s note: Last time i did this it didn’t save properly? Make sure your file is saved properly after Save As and before closing Cytunity)

### 2. Info
![](./_sources_cyunity.md/2.png)

1. **Name**: The name of the song.

2. **Author**: (Optional)

3. **Song**: The song file. (supported format: .wav and .ogg)

4. **BG**: Background picture (.png only)

5. **Logo**: (NOT NEEDED FOR CYTOID)

Cytunity will auto-generate save name based on Info Name, so you may want to fill it properly.

Before you can even chart, you need a song file first. It's mandatory.

Note:  
**None of this info actually matters (aside from song and name for charting) because Cytoid uses its own meta file (level.json).**


### 3. Beat Map
![](./_sources_cyunity.md/3.png)

1. BPM: The BPM, or primary BPM of the song you will chart. The icon next to the value is a tool that helps you find the BPM.

2. Page Shift: This offsets your chart’s starting point for the scan line. Use this to have the beginning of each musical bar begin at the top or bottom of the chart.

3. Add Map: Adds an additional chart in the MAPS Section.

4. Load Map: If you have a Cytus text file and want to load it into Cytunity, use this button, and it will create that chart in Cytunity as an additional Map.

5. Export Map: Export your current chart as a Cytus

6. MAPS: This is a place where you manage all your charts for the song you are charting.

7. Level: The difficulty number of your chart

8. Level Tag: Easy, Hard, or Extreme.

### Basic Notes (These are the basic notes in Cytus. There are some specific steps on the holds and Drag notes)

1. Adjust hold note length: Drag the end of the hold note bar up or down.

2. Add drag note to a drag note chain.

    1. First, place another drag note or copy paste 1 drag note.

    2. Move the first note of a chain (if there is only one note in the chain, just drag that note) to the end of the chain you want to extend.

    3. If a chain link icon appears when dragging the drag note over to the end of a drag note chain, release it and the notes will be linked.

### 6. Folders:
You can use this to save certain note patterns you like, or easy note templates.
