## How can I make a chart?

There are two ways to make a chart: using a chart editor and using a text editor. Chart editors are often used because they might save your time and get better results.
However, you can do more features when using a text editor, like [Luna Flina's "Galaxy Collapse"](https://cytoid.io/levels/flina.touhou.collapse) (actually it isn't fully made with a text editor, just hide scanline parts).

### What do I need to make a chart with a chart editor?
